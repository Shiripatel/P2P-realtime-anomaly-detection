# 📊 Real-Time AI-Based Anomaly Detection in P2P Transactions

This project builds a real-time AI system to detect fraudulent activities in Procure-to-Pay (P2P) transactions.  
It uses machine learning models like Isolation Forest and LSTM Autoencoders to identify anomalies, helping businesses reduce financial risks.

We simulate live transaction streaming, detect anomalies in real-time, and visualize them through an interactive dashboard.
